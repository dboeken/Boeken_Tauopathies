# Boeken_Tauopathies

This repository contains the analysis code associated with the Tauopathies single-molecule characterisation project, led by Dorothea BÃ¶ken. This manuscript has been submitted for publication under the title "Small tau aggregates exhibit disease-specific molecular profiles across tauopathies".

This manuscript has been submitted as a preprint via BioRxiv [here](biorxiv/link). A link to the final version will be provided upon publication.

## Prerequisites

This analysis assumes a standard installation of Python 3 (v 3.10.5). For specific package requirements, see the environment.yml file, or  create a new conda environment containing all packages by running ```conda create -f environment.yml```. In addition to the analysis contained here, some simple statistical tests were performed using [GraphPad Prism v 10.4](https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/).

## Raw data

For convenience, example image files are provided here under the ```data``` folder. These data may be used to explore the workflows presented here as described below.


## Workflow

Example raw images are provided here within the ```data``` folder to test the included analysis scripts.

Individual analyses are presented within the ```src``` folder. Where processing order is important for individual analyses, scripts have been numbered and should be run in order before unnumbered counterparts.
